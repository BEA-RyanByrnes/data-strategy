# 2020 Action Plan

The Federal Data Strategy provides a common set of data principles and best practices in implementing data innovations that drive more value for the public. Annual action plans will identify and prioritize practice-related steps for a given year, along with targeted timeframes and responsible entities.
 
The 2020 Action Plan establishes a solid foundation that will support implementation of the strategy over the next decade. Specifically, the plan identifies initial actions for agencies that are essential for establishing processes, building capacity, and aligning existing efforts to better leverage data as a strategic asset.
 
In addition, the 2020 Action Plan includes a series of pilot projects already underway at individual agencies and a set of government-wide efforts designed to support all agencies through the development of tools and resources.
 
Annual Action Plans are developed iteratively with stakeholder feedback and input incorporated along the way. If you’d like to be notified about updates or ways to be involved, please sign up for our news updates. A downloadable PDF will be available soon.

## Agency Actions

Six Agency Actions are identified as foundational steps to support agencies in establishing plans, processes, and priorities for better managing data assets while considering how the agency’s data assets could be leveraged to advance the agency’s mission. Because agencies have different levels of maturity in their current management and use of data, agencies are expected to have different starting points for executing the six Agency Actions. Each agency should first establish a baseline for each action by assessing the agency’s current status, and then develop and implement a plan to fully achieve each action over the course of the next year. The strategy is supported by tools and resources to aid in the execution of the Agency Actions. Resources will be posted to the repository, Federal Enterprise Data Resources, at resources.data.gov throughout the course of the year.

Many of the Agency Actions build on and complement efforts that are already underway in response to other requirements or laws. The graphic below maps each of the six Agency Actions to a set of relevant laws and guidance documents. While future Action Plans will make similar connections between Agency Actions and relevant laws and requirements, all Agency Actions are designed to support agencies in leveraging their data assets.

### Action 1: Identify Data Needs to Answer Priority Agency Questions

By September 2020, all agencies will take initial steps to identify the data needed to answer priority questions of interest to the agency.[^5]

For the past several years through the budget formulation process,  OMB has encouraged agencies to develop multi-year learning agendas. A multi-year learning agenda enables agencies to systematically identify the most critical short- and long-term questions relevant to the programs, policies, and regulations of an agency. The Evidence Act now requires the development of learning agendas,  directing CFO Act agencies to generate a multi-year learning agenda in conjunction with their strategic plans. Agencies develop learning agendas in consultation with both internal and external stakeholders, using the process to generate and organize priority agency questions that can be pursued through activities that include statistics, program evaluation, research, performance management, and policy analysis. Adopting this approach of identifying priority agency questions at the outset helps to establish a process through which an agency can allocate its statistical, performance management, research and evaluation efforts, and funding to the most critical questions that face the agency. 

This approach represents a paradigm shift in how agencies leverage data assets. Rather than constraining research based on data, the learning agenda process ensures that a research agenda starts with the priority agency questions. Once the priority agency questions have been identified, then the agency must contemplate what data are needed to answer the priority agency questions. This critical next step is also explicitly required under the Evidence Act, which states that learning agendas must include “a list of data the agency intends to collect, use, or acquire to facilitate the use of evidence in policymaking.”  Exhibit 6 maps the process by which an agency might approach identifying data needs to answer priority agency questions.

![Data Collection Tree]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/2020-action-plan/data-collection-tree.png "Data Collection Tree")  

The data required to answer a priority agency question might already exist — either in that agency, at another agency, or within a non-Federal entity (e.g., private firm or state/local government). The development and expansion of high-quality data inventories and data catalogs across agencies, as required by the Evidence Act and supported by Actions 6 and 17, will increase agencies’ capacity to determine whether the data required to answer priority agency questions is already collected and maintained within the Federal Government. Under circumstances where the data needed already exist, the next step would be to either directly access the data holdings, or to develop an acquisition strategy to access the needed data. Alternatively, the data required might not exist or might not be accessible because of legal or other barriers, and a new collection effort may be justified. Many agencies already have processes and procedures by which they assess the availability of data to answer priority agency questions, even if the agency does not yet have a formalized learning agenda in place.

### Action 2: Institutionalize Agency Data Governance

All agencies were required by M-19-23 to establish an inclusive and empowered Data Governance Body (DGB) by September 30, 2019, to be chaired by the Chief Data Officer, with participation from relevant senior-level staff in agency business units, data functions, and financial management. 

By January 2020, all agencies will publish documentation related to the DGB (e.g., membership, charter, meeting cadence, and minutes) on their agency data web page (at https://[agency].gov/data) and by November 2020, all agencies will have begun enterprise-wide data governance activities such as capital planning for enterprise data assets and infrastructure, emerging priority data governance areas such as preparing data for use in artificial intelligence, and an agency data strategy or road map, or master data management program.

The DGB should use data maturity models to assess agency capabilities (see Action 3: Assess Data and Related Infrastructure Maturity), and should also seek broad agency input before recommending data investment priorities. The DGB membership should be updated as needed. 

Agencies may refer to A Playbook in Support of the Federal Data Strategy: Getting Started on Prioritizing Data Governance and Assessing Maturity for guidance and support in accomplishing this action as well as Action 3. 

| Milestone                                                                                                                  | Measurement              | Target Date                                                  | Reporting Mechanism                                                          | Required or Encouraged      |

### Action 3: Assess Data and Related Infrastructure Maturity

By May 2020, all agencies will should conduct an initial maturity assessment focusing on data and related data infrastructure (e.g., organizational structures and knowledge bases, policies) to set a baseline for future improvements. 

Maturity assessments allow an organization to evaluate itself against documented best practices, determine gaps, and identify priority areas for improvement. A maturity assessment analyzes all aspects of agency policies, procedures, and operations related to data and data infrastructure, including data governance, data management, data culture, data systems and tools, data analytics, staff skills and capacity, resource capacity, and compliance with law and policy. The results of a maturity assessment feed into the data governance and management processes to inform investment decisions and to prioritize subsequent actions. A maturity assessment should be proactively communicated and explained to employees and repeated periodically, as determined by the agency, to measure progress and prioritize next steps. 

The maturity model used to conduct the maturity assessment should be chosen by the DGB established under Action 2. This assessment will identify readiness to meet other requirements of the strategy and related legal requirements and can be used to make investment decisions and to prioritize subsequent actions. Agencies may refer to A Playbook in Support of the Federal Data Strategy: Getting Started on Prioritizing Data Governance and Assessing Maturity for guidance and support in accomplishing this action as well as Action 2.

| Milestone                                                                                                                                  | Measurement                        | Target Date | Reporting Mechanism | Required or Encouraged      |

### Action 4: Identify Opportunities to Increase Staff Data Skills
 
By Month 2020, all CFO Act agencies, pursuant to M-19-23 and the Evidence Act, will have documented information on their plans to carry out a capacity assessment to assess the coverage, quality, methods, effectiveness, and independence of the statistics, evaluation, research, and analysis efforts of the agency. These assessments may be further leveraged by agencies to identify critical data skills, assess their staffs’ capacities for those skills, identify any gaps, and take actions to ensure that their Federal workforces are well-prepared to support evidence-building activities. 

The staff data skills assessment should align with, and be a part of, ongoing human capital management efforts designed to ensure agencies have skills and competencies needed to effectively accomplish agency mission. This alignment is important since achieving parity between an agency’s data skill needs and its workforce capacity requires repeating this process over time. The assessment has four major components:

1.	Identify critical data skills needed for the agency
2.	Assess the current staff capacity for those data skills 
3.	Perform a data skills gap analysis to prioritize the agency’s needs
4.	Identify and execute approaches to fill those needs

The identification of critical data skills will naturally be informed by the determination of agency priority questions, including those gathered during the development of the learning agenda (see Action 1) and will be addressed in the agency maturity assessment (Action 3). Thoughtful consideration should also be given to identifying a minimum level of data literacy among all staff, including for those performing roles not traditionally considered data related. The agency should assess the data skills possessed by the current workforce and seek to understand data literacy rates among its staff. The gap analysis should determine how much more of each critical skill is required among staff and facilitate a prioritization of needed skills relative to available resources. Options for increasing staff skills capacity may include new analysis or other software tools, easy-to-use dashboards, additional training and educational opportunities, on-the-job rotational learning experiences, participation in data-related communities of practice, and introducing hiring and retention strategies to address gaps.

Note: This action can also serve as one input to the capacity assessment required by CFO Act agencies under the Evidence Act, in coordination with Evaluation Officers.

| Milestone                                                                                                                            | Measurement                        | Target Date | Reporting Mechanism | Required or Encouraged                                        |

### Action 5: Identify Priority Data Assets for Agency Open Data Plans

By January 2020, all agencies will identify their initial list of priority data assets for agency open data plans.  This list will describe data assets that the agency considers especially valuable to the public interest and therefore intends to make available as open government data. Agency open data plans will include (1) processes and procedures that require data collection mechanisms created on or after January 13, 2019, facilitate open formats, and facilitate collaboration with non-Government entities (including businesses), researchers, and the public for the purpose of understanding how data users value and use government data; (2) identify methods to collect and analyze digital information on data asset usage by users within and outside of the agency, including designating a point of contact within the agency to assist the public and  to respond to quality issues, usability issues, recommendations for improvements, and complaints about adherence to open data requirements within a reasonable period of time; (3) develop a process to evaluate and improve the timeliness, completeness, consistency, accuracy, usefulness, and availability of open Government data assets; and (4) includes requirements for meeting the goals of the agency open data plan, including the acquisition.

A playbook and use cases that describe prioritization methodologies and examples of open data access to support this action are available at resources.data.gov.

| Milestone                                                                                                                                                          | Measurement                               | Target Date                                                                                 | Reporting Mechanism                                   | Required or Encouraged    |

| Execute a process to evaluate and improve the timeliness, completeness, consistency, accuracy, usefulness, and availability of open Government data assets         | Qualitative and quantitative improvements | 12 months                                                                                   | strategy.data.gov & agency public data.json APIs      | Required for all agencies |

### Action 6: Publish and Update Data Inventories 
 
By July 2020, all agencies will update existing comprehensive data inventories in accordance with updated standard metadata that facilitates ingestion by data.gov and search engine optimization. At least every 90 days, all agencies will identify missing or incomplete listings in their comprehensive data inventories and ensure metadata is comprehensive for priority data assets, such as data assets included in agency Open Data Plans, identified in Community of Practice Actions 8, 9, and 10, or as identified by the Chief Data Officer Council (CDO Council). 

| Milestone                                                                                      | Measurement                   | Target Date                                    | Reporting Mechanism          | Required or Encouraged    |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Update comprehensive data inventories for overall completeness and priority data asset sprints | Metadata quality improvements | Minimally every 3 months, as often as possible | Agency public data.json APIs | Required for all agencies |
| Update comprehensive data inventory to conform to standard metadata                            | Completion                    | 6 months                                       | Agency public data.json APIs | Required for all agencies |


## Community of Practice Actions

Community of Practice Actions are taken by a specific agency or group of agencies related to a common topic, usually through an established interagency council or other existing coordinating mechanism. Community of Practice Actions seek to integrate and coordinate ongoing efforts related to existing laws, regulations, and executive orders that are particularly relevant to the strategy. For this initial Action Plan, the four Community of Practice Actions included were identified as key opportunities for agencies to build upon ongoing efforts to improve and better coordinate data-related initiatives across agencies. In particular, the Community of Practice Actions included in the 2020 Action Plan capitalize on current work related to the Executive Order on Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence, the Geospatial Data Act of 2018, the Evidence Act, and efforts related to the management and use of several financial management data assets across government. These four actions, undertaken with cross-agency collaboration, will speed and streamline the execution of existing requirements, as depicted in Exhibit 7 below.

### Action 7: Launch a Federal Chief Data Officer Council
 
By January 2020, OMB will launch, and agency CDOs will participate in, a CDO Council, as required by the Evidence Act and detailed in OMB M-19-23. The CDO Council will meet regularly, establish its priorities, and begin to develop resources as required by the Evidence Act to support CDOs in fulfilling their responsibilities under the Evidence Act. Resources may be developed in concert with the FDS team and other councils and will represent government-wide best practices for the generation, use, protection, and dissemination of data; promote and encourage data sharing agreements between agencies; and identify ways in which agencies can improve upon the production of evidence for use in policymaking. The CDO Council’s resources will reflect consultation with the public and engagement with private users of government data and other stakeholders on how to improve access to Federal data assets. In addition, the CDO Council will identify and evaluate new technology solutions for improving the collection and use of data. 

The CDO Council will share responsibility with other government-wide councils that conduct statutory, data-related activities, such as the Interagency Council on Statistical Policy (ICSP) and the Evaluation Officer Council. OMB expects that the activities of these multiple councils will be coordinated through the OMB Federal Data Policy Committee, to be established under Action 12.

#### Footnotes
[^5]: The provisions under Title I of the Evidence Act apply to the 24 agencies identified in the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (CFO Act) in 31 U.S.C. §901(b), but OMB Memorandum M-19-23 strongly recommends participation of all non-CFO Act agencies, and sub-agencies, operational divisions, and bureaus of CFO Act agencies.  Thus, this requirement is only mandatory for agencies that are subject to the Evidence Act’s mandatory requirements but encouraged for all others.
