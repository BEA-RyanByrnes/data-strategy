## Federal Data Strategy Action Plan

Government agencies will implement the Federal Data Strategy through steps identified in annual government-wide action plans. These plans will identify priority action steps for a given year, incrementally build from year to year, and complement as needed requirements of new statute and policy. 

The priority of the Draft Year 1 Action Plan is to align existing efforts and establish a firm basis of tools, processes, and capacities to leverage data as a strategic asset. The Draft Year 1 Action Plan describes the steps that are viewed as fundamental during the first year to execute the full breadth of the Federal Data Strategy over time. They are informed by and built upon previous efforts, align with ongoing Federal Government programs and policies, and complement new statutory requirements.
  
The goal of the Draft Year 1 Action Plan is to begin to implement the Federal Data Strategy through a set of fundamental actions. Specifically: 

* Designated entities will develop and share government-wide resources and/or tools for implementing the Federal Data Strategy related to governance, ethical data management and use, data protection, workforce training, streamlined access to federal data assets, and the establishment of data inventories and data cataloging.
* Specific federal communities will improve the management and use of specific data asset portfolios including geospatial data and financial management data.  
* Federal agencies will begin working across silos to determine how they can better support their missions and serve stakeholders by making better use of the Federal Government’s full portfolio of data assets. Agencies will be investing in necessary infrastructure improvements, including workforce training and improvements related to data protection and access. 

The Draft Year 1 Action Plan consists of 15 fundamental action steps. Each action step describes the action to be taken and desired result, identifies an entity responsible for executing the action, lists related Federal Data Strategy practices, establishes the identified metrics for measuring progress during the first year of implementation, and includes a timeline for completion of the action. Shared action steps, with the exception of Action 1 and 5, have received financial resources as part of the Cross-Agency Priority Goal: Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset. All other action steps are expected to be completed with current agency funding resources.  

The Draft Year 1 Action Plan includes three categories of actions, described below.

* **Shared** actions are led by a single agency or existing council for the benefit of all agencies and with available cross-agency resources. They provide government-wide thought leadership, direction, tools, and/or services for implementing the Federal Data Strategy. Funding is identified to implement each of the identified shared actions through the President’s Management Agenda. 
* **Community** actions are taken by a group of agencies around a common topic, usually through an established cross-agency council or other existing coordinating mechanism, and with available cross-agency resources. They represent ongoing, mature, cross-agency priorities that will use the Federal Data Strategy practices and implementation guidance to more quickly and consistently achieve their goals. 
* **Agency-specific** actions are taken by an individual agency and are designed to build capacity using currently available agency resources. They set expectations for progress and success in implementing the practices.

By focusing on a handful of specific actions at each level of data management and use, this Action Plan establishes an array of foundational actions designed to align activities and set a firm foundation of tools, processes, and capacity to leverage data as a strategic asset.
