## What are Best Practices?

The Federal Data Strategy needs to articulate and encourage practices that will lead to leveraging data as an asset.  To help us develop those practices, we are seeking public input on best practice along four dimensions of the strategy.  Please let us know of best practices you have seen demonstrated in the following areas:

1. Enterprise Data Governance. Briefly describe which best practices the Federal Government should consider as it sets priorities for managing government data as a strategic asset, including establishing data policies, specifying roles and responsibilities for data privacy, security, and confidentiality protection, and monitoring compliance with standards and policies throughout the information lifecycle.

2. Access, Use, and Augmentation. List a few best practices that the Federal Government should consider as it develops policies and practices to enable stakeholders to effectively and efficiently access and use data assets by: (1) making data available more quickly and in more useful formats; (2) maximizing the amount of non-sensitive data shared with the public; and (3) leveraging new technologies and best practices to increase access to sensitive or restricted data while protecting privacy, security, and confidentiality, and the interests of data providers.

3. Decision-Making and Accountability. Which best practices should the Federal Government consider to improve the use of data assets for decision-making and accountability? Specifically, list best practices for: 

    * providing high quality and timely information to inform evidence-based decision-making and learning; 
    * facilitating external research on the effectiveness of government programs and policies which will    inform future policymaking; and 
    * fostering public accountability and transparency by providing accurate and timely spending information, performance metrics, and other administrative data.

4. Commercialization, Innovation, and Public Use. Outline best practices that the Federal Government should consider to facilitate the use of Federal Government data assets by external stakeholders at the forefront of making government data accessible and useful through commercial ventures, innovation, or for other public uses.  Of particular interest are examples of how the Federal Government can promote data use by the private sector and scientific and research communities, by state and local governments for public policy purposes, for education, and in enabling civic engagement. Please include up to four examples of:

    * how enabling external users to access and use government data for commercial and other public purposes    spurs innovative technological solutions and fills gaps in government capacity and knowledge; and
    * how supporting the production and dissemination of comprehensive, accurate, and objective statistics on the state of the nation helps businesses and markets operate more efficiently.
