## What are Best Practices?

The Federal Data Strategy needs to articulate and encourage practices that will lead to leveraging data as a strategic  asset. To develop those practices, we are soliciting public input on best practices along the four areas of the strategy.  Please submit best practices in the following areas: Enterprise Data Governance; Access, Use, and Augmentation; Decision-Making and Accountability; Commercialization, Innovation, and Public Use.

## How can I submit comments on Best Practices?

**We welcome your input to the Federal Data Strategy Best Practices**. Please submit comments by July 27, 2018.
