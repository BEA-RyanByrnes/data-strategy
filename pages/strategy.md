## What are Best Practices?

The Federal Data Strategy needs to articulate and encourage practices that will lead to leveraging data as a strategic  asset. To develop those practices, we are soliciting public input on best practices along the four areas of the strategy.  Please submit best practices in the following areas: Enterprise Data Governance; Access, Use, and Augmentation; Decision-Making and Accountability; Commercialization, Innovation, and Public Use.

## How can I submit comments on Draft Principles and Best Practices?

We welcome your input to the Federal Data Strategy. Please submit comments by July 27, 2018. The comments you provide here will be shared with the [Federal Data Strategy development team](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/CAP_goal_2.html) for follow up. Providing your name and email is optional, but will be included in the feedback shared with the strategy development team. Please do not include any other personally identifiable information. As the strategy development process continues, it is possible that some user comments submitted here may be shared publicly, but without any identifying information.

You many also submit comments via our companion Request for Comments (RFC) on FederalRegister.gov (which will be published on June 27, 2018).
