## What is the Federal Data Strategy?

Th​e use of data is transforming​ ​​the world. The way the Federal Government provides, maintains, and uses data has a unique place in society and maintaining trust in​ ​​federal data is pivotal to a democratic process. The​ ​​Federal​ Government needs a coordinated and integrated approach to using data to deliver on mission, serve the public, and steward resources while respecting privacy and confidentiality.

The Federal Data Strategy will define​ ​Principles, Practices, and a Year 1 Action Plan to deliver​ ​a ​more consistent​ ​approach to federal data stewardship, use,​ ​and access. The Federal Data Strategy development team will also test solutions and assumptions along the way with The Data Incubator Project, which​ ​​will ​help identify priority use cases and methods that should be replicated or scaled.

## Why create a Federal Data Strategy?

In March of 2018, the [President’s Management Agenda](https://www.performance.gov/PMA/PMA.html) laid out a new [Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goal: Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/CAP_goal_2.html) to develop and implement a comprehensive Federal Data Strategy. Over the course of the next year, with input from the full spectrum of government and non-government stakeholders, the first government-wide data strategy will be developed, along with plans for implementation.
## Who is developing the Federal Data Strategy?

In short, we all are. While the [CAP goal co-leads](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/CAP_goal_2.html) and development team are managing the project, the Federal Data Strategy will be built on the expertise and input of those who contribute ideas, examples, comments, and suggestions. If you have any, this is the place to share them.

## How will the Federal Data Strategy be developed?

The Federal Data Strategy will be developed iteratively in four steps, and after each step we will make the findings public and ask for your feedback and input. The strategy will be developed around four topical areas. The Federal Data Strategy development team will pull together a comprehensive strategy from the input and insights contributed by stakeholders. Between now and April 2019, the Federal Data Strategy development team will be seeking and synthesizing inputs and developing solutions through an iterative process. Each quarter, we will publish new draft materials for review and feedback. Stay tuned to [strategy.data.gov](https://strategy.data.gov) to keep up to date and ensure we hear from you.
