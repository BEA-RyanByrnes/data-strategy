## Why create a Federal Data Strategy?

In March of 2018, the [Presidentâ€™s Management Agenda](https://www.performance.gov/PMA/PMA.html) laid out a new Cross-Agency Priority Goal to develop and implement a comprehensive Federal Data Strategy. Over the course of the next year, with input from the full spectrum of government and non-government stakeholders, the first government-wide data strategy will be developed, along with plans for implementation. 

## Who is developing the Federal Data Strategy?

In short, we all are. While the CAP goal co-leads and development team are managing the project, the Federal Data Strategy will be built on the expertise and input of those who contribute ideas, examples, comments, and suggestions.  If you have any, this is the place to share them.
