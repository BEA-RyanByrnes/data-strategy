## The Data Incubator Project

To solve the most pressing issues facing the nation, we must leverage data as a strategic asset. The Federal Data Strategy will highlight examples of the use of data to solve problems and serve the public, with a particular focus on examples that can be replicated or scaled or that solve high-priority problems. A select number of Use Cases deemed “ripe for testing” will be included in The Data Incubator Project.

## How will the Data Incubator Project assess Use Cases?

The Data Incubator Project will further analyze Use Cases that demonstrate the potential for replication, scaling, and mission impact by two methods: 

1.  **Proof Points**: The Data Incubator Project will develop case studies on Use Cases that can help inform the four strategy areas: Enterprise Data Governance; Use, Access, and Augmentation; Decision-making and Accountability; and Commercialization, Innovation, and Public Use. 
2.  **Prototypes**: In the fall of 2018, the Data Incubator Project will partner with the [General Services Administration’s 10x Project](https://10x.gsa.gov/) and [Challenge.gov](https://www.challenge.gov) to host a prize challenge related to prototype projects as part of The Data Incubator Project. In the spring of 2018 these prototypes will be demoed in a showcase event where promising projects may be awarded additional funding.

## What will the Data Incubator Project do with the Use Case List?

The Data Incubator Project will examine Use Cases submitted during our last round of feedback as well as best practices in the field to develop proof point case analyses. All prototype project ideas will be need to be submitted, or re-submitted, to Challenge.gov to be considered for funding. 

## How can I include my project idea in The Data Incubator Project?

We’re excited that you want to include a project in The Data Incubator Project! If you have a project that you think would make for a good proof point case study, please use the form below to submit it. If you have a project idea ripe for prototype funding, stay tuned for the posting of the prize challenge. As always you can check this website as well as our newsletter for regular updates. 

The Proof Point case studies you provide here will be shared with the Federal Data Strategy development team for follow up. Providing your name and email is optional, but will be included in the feedback shared with the strategy development team. Please do not include any other personally identifiable information. As the strategy development process continues, it is possible that some user comments submitted here may be shared publicly, but without any identifying information.
