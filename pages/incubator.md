## Why does the Federal Data Strategy need Use Cases?

Many high-level civic data challenges have been identified in the past–archaic data management practices and IT legacy systems, issues with data sharing and interoperability, and a lack of secondary use considerations.  But the Federal Government lacks an overall approach to tackle these challenges and prioritize data infrastructure improvements that serve the public. The Federal Data Strategy needs priority data Use Cases to ensure it is comprehensive and actionable.  

## How will the Federal Data Strategy incorporate Use Cases?

These Use Cases will be identified and discussed in the Federal Data Strategy, and a select number of ready Use Cases will be assessed more deeply in *The Data Incubator Project*.

## How will select Use Cases be incubated?

To be “ripe for testing,” Use Cases must demonstrate the potential for replication, scaling, and mission impact. They also must have a ready team for further exploration and assessment purposes. The Data Incubator Project is not a new platform or set of resources, but rather is focused research aimed at identifying methods for the Federal Data Strategy and for agencies going forward. The Federal Data Strategy team will seek academic, private sector, and NGO partnerships to further our learning from The Data Incubator Project.

## How can I submit a Use Case?

Our first feedback round concluded on July 30, 2018, and we are now working to incorporate your feedback into our Principles and Draft Practices, as well as review all the use cases submitted. In October, we will publish the next set of deliverables, including the Draft Practices document for your review and input.

You may also review the public comments submitted via our companion [Cross-Agency Priority Goal: Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset Request for Comments (RFC) on FederalRegister.gov](https://www.regulations.gov/docketBrowser?rpp=25&so=DESC&sb=commentDueDate&po=0&dct=PS&D=USBC-2018-0011).
