## How can I provide feedback on the Federal Data Strategy?

Our first feedback round concluded on July 30, 2018, and we are now working to incorporate your feedback into our Principles and Draft Practices, as well as review all the use cases submitted. In October, we will publish the next set of deliverables, including the Draft Practices document for your review and input.

You may also review the public comments submitted via our companion [Cross-Agency Priority Goal: Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset Request for Comments (RFC) on FederalRegister.gov](https://www.regulations.gov/docketBrowser?rpp=25&so=DESC&sb=commentDueDate&po=0&dct=PS&D=USBC-2018-0011).
