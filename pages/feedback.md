## Action Steps
After you have learned about the Draft Practices, please provide us feedback on Year 1 Action Steps. What action steps are associated with each practice? 

For guidance in proposing action steps, use the following as examples of specific practices and associated action steps.  These examples are provided for guidance only.

* Practice:  Prioritize Data Security
    
    Example Action Steps:  
    1. Leverage existing standards for comprehensive and high quality data management.
    2. Define, implement, and maintain formal expectations throughout government for data oversight and transparency.
* Practice:  Connect Federal Spending to Outcomes
    
    Example Action Steps 
    1. Publish interactive reports with spending, performance, and mission-support data that enable the public to interact with the data and create customizable tables and report.  These interactive charts and graphics should be embedded in Federal websites such as USAspending.gov and performance.gov.
    2. Standardize reporting data for federal grants to help make the data more accessible and useful.
