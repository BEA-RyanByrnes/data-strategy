## How can I provide feedback on the Federal Data Strategy?


We invite stakeholders to provide feedback on the Draft Year 1 Action Plan . We accept written comments through various feedback channels, including the Federal Register, web form submissions, and the Federal Data Strategy GitHub site. Stakeholders may also participate in open forums for discussing the Strategy.

There are multiple channels for providing feedback:

* Federal Register: You may submit comments via our companion Cross-Agency Priority Goal: Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset Request for Comments Phase 3 (RFC)  on FederalRegister.gov.
* Web form: You may submit comments on the Draft Year 1 Action Plan  page of this website.
* GitHub: You may also submit comments via our Federal Data Strategy [GitHub site](https://github.com/GSA/data-strategy/issues/new).

Please submit your comment once using your preferred feedback platform.
