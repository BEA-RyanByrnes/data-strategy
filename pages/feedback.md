## How can I provide feedback on the Federal Data Strategy?

There are several opportunities for stakeholders to provide feedback on the Federal Data Strategy. We accept written comments through various feedback channels, including the Federal Register, web form submissions, and the Federal Data Strategy GitHub site. Stakeholders may also participate in open forums for discussing the Federal Data Strategy.   
 
Our comment process is iterative.  As we release draft products, we accept comments for incorporation in the next release of products. Following the public comments received so far, the Federal Data Strategy team has developed Principles, Practices and the Draft Year-1 Action Plan.  
 
If you'd like to be notified about the next iteration of the Federal Data Strategy, please [sign up for our news updates](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USGSA/subscribers/new?topic_id=USGSA_756).
