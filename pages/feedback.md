## How can I provide feedback on the Federal Data Strategy?


There are several opportunities for stakeholders to provide feedback on the Federal Data Strategy.  We accept written comments through various feedback channels, including the Federal Register, web form submissions, and the Federal Data Strategy GitHub site.  Stakeholders may also participate in open forums for discussing the federal strategy.    
 
Our comment process is iterative.  As we release draft products, we accept comments for incorporation in the next release of products.  Following the public comments received so far, the Federal Data Strategy team has developed Principles and Draft Practices.  
 
Our next round of public comments will open in early 2019. If you'd like to be notified, please [sign up for our news updates](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/CAP_goal_2.html#GD-snippet-form).
