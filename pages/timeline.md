## What are Best Practices?

The Federal Data Strategy needs to articulate and encourage practices that will lead to leveraging data as a strategic  asset. To develop those practices, we are soliciting public input on best practices along the four areas of the strategy.  Please submit best practices in the following areas: Enterprise Data Governance; Access, Use, and Augmentation; Decision-Making and Accountability; Commercialization, Innovation, and Public Use.

## How can I submit comments on Best Practices?

Our first feedback round concluded on July 30, 2018, and we are now working to incorporate your feedback into our Principles and Draft Practices, as well as review all the use cases submitted. In October, we will publish the next set of deliverables, including the Draft Practices document for your review and input.

You may also review the public comments submitted via our companion [Cross-Agency Priority Goal: Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset Request for Comments (RFC) on FederalRegister.gov](https://www.regulations.gov/docketBrowser?rpp=25&so=DESC&sb=commentDueDate&po=0&dct=PS&D=USBC-2018-0011).
