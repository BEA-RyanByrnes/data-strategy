# 2020 Action Plan (Placeholder)

The Federal Data Strategy provides a common set of data principles and best practices in implementing data innovations that drive more value for the public. Annual action plans will identify and prioritize practice-related steps for a given year, along with targeted timeframes and responsible entities.
 
The 2020 Action Plan establishes a solid foundation that will support implementation of the strategy over the next decade. Specifically, the plan identifies initial actions for agencies that are essential for establishing processes, building capacity, and aligning existing efforts to better leverage data as a strategic asset.
 
In addition, the 2020 Action Plan includes a series of pilot projects already underway at individual agencies and a set of government-wide efforts designed to support all agencies through the development of tools and resources.
 
Annual Action Plans are developed iteratively with stakeholder feedback and input incorporated along the way.
