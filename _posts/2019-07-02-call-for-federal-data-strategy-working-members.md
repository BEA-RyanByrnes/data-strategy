The Executive Office of the President is seeking team members from the federal agencies to work on the Federal Data Strategy (FDS) which is part of the President’s Management Agenda Cross-Agency Priority Goal on Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset. The FDS lays out a comprehensive, long-term approach to leveraging data to improve the ability of federal agencies to deliver mission outcomes, provide excellent service, and effectively steward taxpayer dollars on behalf of the American people.
