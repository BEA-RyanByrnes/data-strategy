When we joined the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) ten years ago, we each experienced obstacles to sharing data across programs. Curtis, as a reporting lead, recalls when missing reference data would impact analysis capabilities, while Jen found it painful to access information necessary to determine the single source of truth in the data. We soon joined with a dozen other frustrated colleagues to create solutions. Calling ourselves the Data Stewardship Tactical Working Group (DSTWG), we built trust with our colleagues across DHS through our consistent willingness to learn from them. We invoked the term ‘data stewardship’ because we shared the conviction that applying leadership and accountability to standardizing data will help the Department’s operational units communicate better. The ‘tactical working group’ label promoted urgency and openness while conveying our commitment to tackling real, rubber-meets-the-road issues.

We met on a weekly basis, taking turns to break down our programs’ common data, identifying strengths and gaps. This allowed us to unify all “in use” data into a single source of truth and develop a solution for managing what was out of alignment. The work soon grew into a full-scale analysis of the current DHS Standard Tables, the data assets we share across DHS systems. 

The DHS Location Standard Expansion effort is a great example of how shaping the Standard Tables through stewardship and community has improved operations in concrete and meaningful ways. Our location data helps the public get to the correct place to receive services in a timely manner. Without well-managed standards, those who depend on us would receive conflicting information, leading to delayed service delivery, increased call center load, and damaged organizational credibility. Lessons from this effort helped us expand the standard to include information critical to related domains. As a result, five new stewards were appointed and better processes were put in place to manage the data as they change.

Today, the DSTWG operates out of DHS HQ and at a much larger scale. Its 600+ members facilitate standards building, tool development, and Data Governance training. Our work supports people at every stage of the data lifecycle: the clerk entering data, the operator responsible for records management, the developer setting up an API call, and the people who need to share, report, or understand our data.

Helping DHS become a more data-literate and data-driven organization is no easy task and requires results. Even as we relate our progress here, we acknowledge how much work yet remains. That said, we hope our story inspires you to replicate our path at your own agency. To get started, try convening your own data community (and don’t be afraid to start small!). Make a commitment to unify, build trust, learn together, and support one another. Demonstrate responsiveness by surveying your colleagues about what tools and training would help their programs improve. Share those results and make sure you respond to them with concrete action aimed at serving your colleagues’ needs. While you help work through their challenges, you’ll have a perfect opportunity to demonstrate the finer points of good data management!
