    <h2> What is the Federal Data Strategy?</h2>

    <p>
    On behalf of the public, the Federal government holds vast stores of data on nearly all topics - people, health, crime, economics, education, the weather, volcanos, transportation â€“ the list goes on. Some data are collected directly from people and businesses through surveys like the Census. Other data are gathered as people and businesses engage government agencies to receive services. Still more data are created by sensors, satellites and radars. Regardless of how the data are created, in many cases they have value not only related to their original function, but also from secondary uses.  A comprehensive Federal Data Strategy will help identify, unleash, and leverage these secondary uses through a set of principles, practices, and action steps.  These will lead us to a uniform approach to data stewardship, use and access.

        <h3>Access, Use, and Augmentation</h3>
        <p>
          Develop policies and procedures that enable stakeholders to effectively and efficiently access and use data assets by: (1) making data available more quickly and in more useful formats; (2) maximizing the amount of non-sensitive data shared with the public; (3) leveraging new technologies and best practices to increase access to sensitive or restricted data while protecting privacy, security, and confidentiality, and the interests of data providers.

        <h3>Decision Making &amp; Accountability</h3>
        <p>
          Improve the use of data assets for decision-making and accountability for the Federal Government, including both internal and external uses. This includes: (1) providing high quality and timely information to inform evidence-based decision-making and learning; (2) facilitating external research on the effectiveness of government programs and policies which will inform future policymaking; and (3) fostering public accountability and transparency by providing accurate and timely spending information, performance metrics, and other administrative data.

        <h3>Commercialization, Innovation, and Public Use</h3>
        <p>
          Facilitate the use of Federal Government data assets by external stakeholders at the forefront of making government data accessible and useful through commercial ventures, innovation, or for other public uses. This includes use by the private sector and scientific and research communities, by state and local governments for public policy purposes, for education, and in enabling civic engagement. Enabling external users to access and use government data for commercial and other public purposes spurs innovative technological solutions and fills gaps in government capacity and knowledge. Supporting the production and dissemination of comprehensive, accurate, and objective statistics on the state of the nation helps businesses and markets operate more efficiently.
