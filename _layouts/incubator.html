        <h3>Public Safety</h3>
        <p>
          Emergency responders rely on up-to-date addresses for timely response. The Federal Geospatial Data Committee recognizes the need for a free, open, and up-to-date <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/nad">National Address Database</a> (NAD) to serve these critical needs as well as a broad range of government services such as mail delivery, permitting, and school siting. Based on a minimum content approach, the Department of Transportation and the US Census Bureau’s NAD pilot collected and standardized addresses from 22 state partners.
